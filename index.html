      <h2>Interests</h2>

			<img src="Web Images/Web3Connections.JPG" alt="Web3"/>

      <p>I’m deeply passionate about exploring the evolving landscape of Web3 and decentralized technologies. Researching innovative blockchain projects isn’t just a hobby—it’s a pursuit that fuels my curiosity and keeps me connected to the future of finance, governance, and digital identity. I’m especially drawn to understanding the social, psychological, and economic implications of these technologies, which I often explore through non-fiction literature and thought-provoking documentaries.

			<br/><br/>

			Outside of the digital world, I seek inspiration through science fiction TV shows, where imagination and futuristic concepts often hint at real-world innovation. These narratives help me think beyond the present, encouraging creative perspectives on what’s possible in tech and society.

			<br/><br/>

			Balance is key for me, and I find it through skateboarding, which keeps me grounded and in the moment. I also have a strong passion for adventurous travel—discovering new cultures, places, and experiences on a whim. I thrive on spontaneity, valuing the freedom to explore, take risks, and embrace the unexpected. Whether I’m diving deep into research or taking off on an impromptu journey, I’m always chasing growth, insight, and authentic experiences.</p>
